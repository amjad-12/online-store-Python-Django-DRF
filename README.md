# amjad-store
This project is an online store The way it works: The first case: If you are not a user, you can take a cart and put in it different products from different groups in the store and see the price of the cart Or if you sign up and then take a cart and fill it with stuff, you can order this cart because when you sign up the app will take your refresh token or access token, The second case, if you are an admin, you can add products with a picture of the product, you can see the users and assign new admins, and you can also see all the orders and what goods were ordered in each order. I made a filter method for Products and users that make it easier for you to deal with the site The advantage of this project is that the method of querying and preloading from databases was created very carefully, which led to the speed of intense queries and this makes the site distinguished In addition to the signals that were added between the tables and between the apps within the project, and of course, it was taken into account that we do not make any of the applications within the project have dependence on another application and also worked on the principle that premature optimization is the root of all evil, so you will find the project strong, professional, It has a lot of features and at the same time very simple.
